resolution-tool
===============

Takes vector images and prepares it for multi-resolution rasterization

Right now, the tool is implemented in Python using PyCairo (for vector graphics) and wxPython (for UI). It is surprisingly rather difficult to set up the development environment, but it got done after following the steps found on this web page: www.matan.ca/install-cairo-wxpyton-pycairo-python-windows

These are the following packages I have downloaded to make the resolution-tool on Windows:
python-2.7.3 (Python 2.7 Installer)
wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27 (wxPython 2.8 Installer)
wxPython2.8-win32-docs-demos-2.8.12.1 (wxPython 2.8 Docs and Demos Installer *not required, but useful for later when you check to see if everything works properly)
py2cairo-1.10.0.win32-py2.7 (pyCairo 1.10 Installer)
cairo_1.8.6-1_win32 (Cairo DLL)
libpng_1.2.34-1_win32 (libpng DLL)
zlib123-dll (zlib DLL)
wingide-101-4.0.1-1 (Wing IDE Installer)
